## ✨ Project Tagline
Uncover the souls of art through AI-powered interpretations.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Many people find classic art intimidating or difficult to connect with on a deeper level. Without context or interpretation, the rich stories and emotions behind masterpieces can be lost, making art less accessible and engaging for the general public.

## 🚀 Our Solution: LumenAI
LumenAI is an innovative web application that bridges the gap between classic art and modern understanding using AI insights. Our platform offers a curated collection of art pieces, each accompanied by an AI-generated interpretation to enhance viewer engagement and comprehension.

### Key Features:
* **Curated Art Gallery:** Explore a diverse collection of classic artworks.
* **AI Insight Panel:** Instantly reveal unique interpretations for each art piece with a single click.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Easily browse sections like Home, Explore, About, and Contact.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Frontend:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3 (with `responsive.css` for media queries)
    * JavaScript (Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation and logic)
* **External Libraries/APIs:**
    * Font Awesome (for icons)
    * Unsplash (for placeholder art images)
    * *(If you integrated any actual AI API for interpretations, list it here, e.g., "OpenAI API for interpretations" or "Google Cloud Vision API")*
